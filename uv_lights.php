    <h2 style="color: #39B261;">How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p class="lead my-4" style="font-size: 1.1em">
      UV light destroy microbes in air conditioners. The lights are installed in your ductwork or near the AC coil, and they destroy microbes like mold, bacteria, fungi, mildew, mold spores and viruses in the line-of-sight of the UV bulb. According to a study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC93076/" style="color: #39B261;">Journal of Applied and Environmental Microbiology</a> found that after using UV lights in a commercial HVAC air handler for four months, fungal levels in the UV test units were significantly lower than in control units.

            Because UV lights kill microbes, mold spores and viruses, your family will be less prone to colds and flu, and anecdotal reports indicate that allergy symptoms can be greatly reduced. UV lights may also be helpful for those with respiratory problems, pulmonary disease, COPD and asthma because they neutralize VOCs that can irritate the throat and lungs. The lights also keep your air conditioner clean, so the unit will be more effective and efficient.

            For the lights to be effective, ductwork must be sealed, and you must use air filters with a high MERV rating. You must change the filters monthly and tune up your air conditioner annually. UV lights only kill organic contaminants; they do not remove inorganic particles like pet dander or dust, and they do not kill dust mites.

            The bulbs are easy to install: a Right Now Air Solutions technician will typically mount one near the AC coil with a magnet. Maintenance is also easy: We'll simply replace the bulb when it burns out. Bulbs can typically last for up to 12 months, and the additional energy usage costs about $2 per month.
